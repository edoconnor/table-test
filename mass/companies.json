Maxwell's biomimetic therapeutics have been shown by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) to be effective against all coronaviruses tested including SARS-CoV-2, SARS-1, MERS, and Coronavirus Beta. Maxwell's CLAROMER&#153; brand anti-infectives platform outputs a diverse library of oligomeric structures demonstrated to be well tolerated in animals and to potently disrupt the membranes of a broad spectrum of viruses and other pathogens, as shown in preclinical animal studies and electron micrograph imaging of bacterial, viral and fungal structures after CLAROMER treatment. They have also been shown in preclinical studies to be well tolerated in human tissues in vitro and in vivo in animal studies. Maxwell's technology is protected by granted patents and is led by a world-class team of experienced life science executives.",
